Why SCISSORSTORIES
Remember those days of getting a bizarre hair cut from a stylist, which made you look for another new salon? Or searching for “best salons” on web 
and failed to get accurate results? Well, We're here to help make sure those are behind us.

Making the right choices with your beauty & wellness services isn't easy. It's hard to know where to look to get inspired, to find all the current trends 
and to pick a style that'll suit you. And if you do, finding the right stylist at the right salon to re-create the look is often left to chance.

WHAT WE DO
SCISSORSTORIES is a marketplace which connects people with Beauty & Wellness venues and Stylists. We’re building a new way to discover and experience beauty & 
wellness services online.

We gather information from salons on a regular basis to ensure our data is fresh and create a portfolio of stylists & hairdressers working with each salon.
Each of the hairdresser or barbers has their portfolio of real work, and each style is smartly categorised.

Salons, Stylists and Barbers simply upload their work, allowing users to pick from real work on real users. We then link users with the hairdressers that
have created the look they love. Rather than relying on online reviews or picking a salon and hoping for the best that they can understand and interpret 
their request, clients can now go directly to the source of their inspiration.
